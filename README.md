## ✨✨ Skills learnt in this project :
- Learnt to handle errors and exceptions and to perform validation.

- Understood the basics of Authentication, Authorization and concept of JWT and then moved ahead to secure the API’s with JWT(JSON Web Token) and OAuth2.

- Built multiple database entities and learnt to develop relationships between different models using multiple databases like SQL Lite, MySQL, PostgreSQL and SQLAlchemy library.

- Also learnt how to setup the database configuration and how to use the database explorer to visualize the data inside the database.

- Next I've moved on to defining different schemas with the help of Pydantic library where I converted data between models and schemas.

- Gained insights on how to secure an API endpoint behind JWT authentication.

- Also learnt to use OpenAPI/Swagger docs with FastAPI to test my application.

- At last I've have enabled CORS on the APIs.
