We will build a complete real world application use case by developing the all the API’s using FAST API python framework, along the way we will learn the details of Fast API framework and also compare it with other API development Frameworks.

We will learn to handle errors and exceptions and how to perform validation.

We learn then learn the basics of Authentication, Authorization and concept of JWT and then go ahead to secure our API’s with JWT(Json Web Token) and OAuth2.

We will build multiple database entities and learn to develop relationships between different models using multiple databases like SQL Lite, MySQL, PostgreSQL and SQLAlchemy library.

We will also learn how to setup the database configuration and also how to use the database explorer to visualize our data inside the database.

Next we will move on to defining different schemas with the help of Pydantic library. We will see how to convert data between models and schemas.

We will learn how to secure an API endpoint behind JWT authentication.

We will learn to use OpenAPI/Swagger docs with FastAPI to test our application.

We will then go ahead and enable CORS on our APIs.

We will learn to commit our code to Github.

Finally we will deploy our Application on cloud server.
