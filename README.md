## ✨✨ Skills learnt in this project :
- Learnt to handle _errors_ and _exceptions_ and to perform **validation**.

- Understood the basics of **Authentication**, **Authorization** and concept of **JWT** and then moved ahead to secure the **API’s** with **JWT(JSON Web Token)** and **OAuth2**.

- Built multiple database entities and learnt to develop relationships between different models using multiple databases like **_SQL Lite_**, **MySQL**, **PostgreSQL** and **_SQLAlchemy_** library.

- Also learnt how to setup the database configuration and how to use the _database explorer_ to visualize the data inside the database.

- Next I've moved on to defining different schemas with the help of **_Pydantic_** library where I converted data between *models* and *schemas*.

- Gained insights on how to secure an _**API** endpoint_ behind **JWT** authentication.

- Also learnt to use _**OpenAPI/Swagger** docs_ with _**FastAPI**_ to test my application.

- At last I've have enabled **CORS** on the **APIs**.
